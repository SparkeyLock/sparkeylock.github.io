My friend and I visited the Zhuhai International Air Show. We are enthusiasts so we are familiar with some of the exhibits. We watched some spectacular flying displays this morning. Because there were so many people visiting, I only had a limited time to take out my camera to take pictures.  
BTW, I used a sony Î±6700 and the 16-50mm f/2.8 lens.
