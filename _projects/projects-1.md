<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The full name of the project is "Investigation of Water Aging Resistance Properties in Evotherm Warm Mix Rubber Asphalt".
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">At the time, I was pursuing my studies in Road and Bridge Engineering at the School of Civil Engineering, Guangzhou University. After six months of specialized coursework, I developed a strong interest in scientific research and reached out to <a href="https://tm.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1058/2735.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Yang Guoliang</a>, one of my course instructors.
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Through a month of intensive preparation and collaborative efforts with my team members, we successfully completed the research proposal and preliminary report. Subsequently, in March 2018, our project passed the rigorous evaluation by the university's expert panel and secured funding support from both the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education and Guangzhou University.
