<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The full name of the project is "Investigation of Water Aging Resistance Properties in Evotherm Warm Mix Rubber Asphalt".

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">At the time, I was pursuing my studies in Road and Bridge Engineering at the School of Civil Engineering, Guangzhou University. After six months of specialized coursework, I developed a strong interest in scientific research and reached out to <a href="https://tm.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1058/2735.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Yang Guoliang</a>, one of my course instructors.

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Through a month of intensive preparation and collaborative efforts with my team members, we successfully completed the research proposal and preliminary report. Subsequently, in March 2018, our project passed the rigorous evaluation by the university's expert panel and secured funding support from both the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education and Guangzhou University.

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">To be honest, I didn’t have a deep understanding of road engineering materials at that time, and the topic selection came from the suggestions of my senior and tutor. It has been five years since the project ended. Looking back now, this project was a good exercise for me, which gave me a deeper understanding of scientific research and the social value behind it. In addition to analyzing and studying asphalt, a specific road engineering material, at the chemical and physical levels, this project also includes the most basic research significance and purpose: studying the application and performance optimization of rubber asphalt binders formed by reprocessing waste tires and matrix asphalt can greatly alleviate the pressure on the environment caused by a large number of waste tires eliminated in my country; at the same time, this project studies how new rubber asphalt binders can improve their performance with the help of warm mix technology and warm mix agents.
