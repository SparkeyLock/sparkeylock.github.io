<span style="font-size:28px; font-weight:bold">WELCOME!</span>

I graduated with a degree in Landscape Architecture from Guangzhou University. From 2018 to 2020, I served as a research assistant at the Road and Bridge Engineering Institute, Guangzhou University. Currently, I'm working as a landscape design intern at the Architectural Design and Research Institute of Guangzhou University.

This is my first time learning to code and building a personal website. While I've used many academic websites before, I believe customizing my own site through coding would be more fulfilling. Beyond showcasing academic achievements and professional work, I'll also share blog articles and photography projects here.
