## Project Experience

* Feb. 2018- Nov. 2020: Investigation of Water Aging Resistance Properties in Evotherm warm mix rubber asphalt
  * Role: Principal Investigator  
  * Project Description:  
    * Designed accelerated ageing simulations under varied thermo-oxidative-hydrothermal conditions to evaluate bitumen performance degradation.
    * Characterised moisture resistance through macro-performance tests (penetration/ductility/softening point) coupled with microstructural analysis.
    * Elucidated ageing mechanisms via FTIR-monitored functional group evolution.
  * Key Outcomes:  
    * Research published in 3 journals indexed by Chinese Science Citation Database (Highway, China Adhesives, Synthetic Rubber Industry).
    * Awarded "Excellent Completion" by Guangdong Department of Education and Department of Science & Technology.
  * Funding:  
    * Open Sharing Fund for Large Equipment of Guangzhou University (GZ [2018] No. 120).
    * Guangzhou University undergraduate training program for innovation and entrepreneurship (201811078121).
