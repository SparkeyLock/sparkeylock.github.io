Actually this interface is primarily optimized for **desktop** and **large-screen devices**. While mobile browsers can automatically adapt the layout, the rendering quality is significantly compromised. Currently, I haven't had the time to develop dedicated responsive designs for mobile or small-screen devices.

  <strong>Guangzhou University - Urban Landscape Hydrology Studio</strong>
  <span>Sep. 2019 - Dec.2022</span>

<div style="font-style: italic;">
  Research Assistant | Supervisor: <a href="https://arch.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1113/4000.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Wang Mo</a> 
</div>

* Participated in drafting a chapter of the application documents and conducting data simulations for space optimization.
* Participated in proposing a flood disaster risk assessment framework that integrates a Weighted Naive Bayesian classifier and a Complex Network Model. This framework can be used to estimate flood risk probability in data-poor regions, generate flood hazard risk maps, and analyze the relationship between flood risk and its driving factors.

  Project: <a href="/projects/projects-1">Study of water aging mechanism of warm mixed rubber asphalt</a>
</div>

* Duties included:
  * Designed heat-oxygen-water coupling aging experiments for Evotherm warm mix  rubber asphalt, prepared test specimens.
  * Quantified material performance under various aging conditions through penetration/ductility/softening point tests.
  * Analyzed hydroxyl/carbonyl functional group variations using FTIR spectroscopy, revealing moisture-accelerated aging mechanisms.
  * Contributed to data analysis for 3 journal publications.
* Key Achievements:
  * Discovered liquid water's stronger aging impact than vapor phase.
  * Established FTIR spectral system for water-induced asphalt aging.
